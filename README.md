lua example to modify all parts of a custom device
 
As text tiles are limited in their presentations options.  
I decided next best would be to modify a custom sensor.  
As examples are scarce I share my snippet.  

First create a dummy custom sensor and note its idx.  
Modify the lines as indicated in the script and try this snippet.  

Beware the JSON calls are very sensitive.  
First try the example before you are going to edit.  

Do not forget to refresh your page as not all is updated dynamicly.
